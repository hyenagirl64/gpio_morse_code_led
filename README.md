## For ASUS Tinkerboard
#### by Hyenagirl64


### Circut

This code assumes an output is connected to GPIO pin 12 (this was tested using an LED for output)

### Opertation

Run the program.

You may now enter a message to send to the output.  The message may contain any letters, numbers and the special characters .,/?!@#$&()-_=+'"

Hit "return" to send the message.

The message will be preceeded by an "ATTENTION" signal (KA) and followed by "OVER AND OUT" (SK)

You may exit the program by entering "/q"

### Extensions

The translator module supports several standard pro-signs that can be called externally
